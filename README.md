# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview

Pewlett Hackard is a large company that is looking toward the future of baby boomers in two ways. First, it is offering a retirement package for those who meet certain criteria. Second, it's starting to think about which positions will need to be filled in the near future. I helped Bobby who is an up and coming HR analysit in the comapny to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
